# koto security assessment triage — 2026-09-11

Source: an automated assessment producing 339 findings (2 high, 166 medium,
171 low) against the daemon, guest agent, sidecar scripts and TUI.

This file is the ledger: every finding gets a verdict, and a verdict of
*accepted* or *not a finding* carries its reasoning, because an unexplained
"won't fix" is indistinguishable from an oversight on the next audit.

Verdicts:

- **fixed** — code changed, pinned by a test in `daemon/audit_fixes_test.go`.
- **accepted** — real, but the risk is the trust model's stated position.
- **not a finding** — the precondition does not exist, or the claim is wrong.

### H1 — Legacy `workspace.img` symlink enables cross-boundary VM disk redirection (`daemon/fc.go`) — **fixed**

`fcEnsureWorkspaceImg` accepted the image with `os.Stat`, which follows
symlinks, and every consumer downstream works on the PATH: `os.Truncate` +
`e2fsck` + `resize2fs` in the grow path, `os.Chown` in `fcJailFixupPerms`, and
the jail shim's bind mount, which hands the resolved inode to the guest as a
read-write block device — where the guest's mount fallback (`mkfs.ext4 -F` on
an unmountable `/dev/vdb`) would format it.

Planting the symlink needs write access to `groups/<g>/`, which under
Firecracker is tier 1 (there is no shared filesystem). The one exception is
the case the finding names: a **podman-era** workspace, which the migration
path deliberately treats as pre-existing untrusted input, and which a podman
sidecar had RW.

Fixed by `os.Lstat` + a regular-file check before anything touches the path.
Refusing the whole class beats reasoning about who wrote it.
`TestWorkspaceImgRefusesNonRegularFile`.

### H2 — Jailed Firecracker can impersonate its guest on the privileged host control plane (`daemon/fc.go`) — **accepted**

True as stated, unclosable, and not an escalation.

Firecracker's hybrid vsock makes every guest→host connection a `connect(2)`
**by the VMM process** to `<uds>_<port>` (see the channel map at the top of
`fc.go`). The VMM is definitionally the peer, so `SO_PEERCRED` cannot
distinguish "VMM relaying its guest" from "VMM acting alone", and a per-VM MAC
would have to be handed to the guest through that same VMM.

What the channel grants is exactly the authority the group's own guest already
holds — and a VMM compromise is reached *through* that guest, via a
virtio/vsock device-model bug, so the attacker held it already. The jailer's
actual claim is narrower and still holds: a VMM escape reaches no credentials,
no network, no other group's sockets, and no host filesystem outside its
chroot. Recorded in the comment at `fcJailFixupPerms`.

### M3 — DNS rebinding bypasses the HTTP egress destination policy (`daemon/proxy.go`) — **fixed**

`egressConnect` pinned its dial to the vetted IP; `egressHTTP` did not — it
handed the original URL to a shared `http.Client`, whose transport re-resolved
the name inside `Do()`. The comment there acknowledged the window and deferred
it on the grounds that plain-HTTP egress is rare. It is still a wide window,
because the daemon's own dial is not behind the guest's L3 frame filter: a
guest controlling DNS for a name it is allowed to reach could steer the
DAEMON's connection at a destination its profile forbids.

Fixed with a per-request `http.Transport` whose `DialContext` ignores the
address the transport resolved and dials the vetted `ip:port`. The Host header
still rides `r.URL`, so the origin sees the name it was asked for. The dial
guard `egressConnect` already had (never dial the control plane, whatever the
check said) is applied on this path too, and `serveEgress` now defaults a
missing port from the URL scheme so the vetted address is a complete `ip:port`.
`TestEgressHTTPDialsVettedIP`.

### M6 — IPv6 AWS metadata endpoint bypasses the guest egress filter (`daemon/fcnet.go`) — **fixed**

`169.254.169.254` — the metadata endpoint for AWS, GCP, Azure and most others
— is link-local, so `fcClassifyDst` already returned `fcDstCtl` for it. AWS's
IPv6 IMDS is `fd00:ec2::254`, a ULA, which `IsPrivate()` classes as LAN: a
`lan` or `full` guest on a dual-stack host could read the instance's role
credentials. `Ec2MetadataAccess: false` does not cover it — that governs the
netstack's own answer, not a host-routed dial.

Classified as control plane, so it is denied under every profile, on both the
frame filter and the L7 proxy. `TestIPv6MetadataIsControlPlane`.

### M10 — Independent DNS lookups bypass the boot-time egress profile (`daemon/proxy.go`) — **fixed**

`serveEgress` called `egressTargetAllowed` twice — once for the config profile,
once for the booted one — and kept the vetted IP from the first. Each call did
its own `egressLookupIP`, so a rebinding name answering LAN then WAN passed
`full` on lookup one and `wan` on lookup two while the dial went to the LAN
address the booted profile forbids.

Fixed by intersecting the two profiles first (`egressIntersect`) and checking
once, which also makes "the stricter of the two" a property of the value rather
than of the call sequence. `wan ∩ lan` is `none`, which is correct: a group
that booted `wan` and now reads `lan` reaches nothing until the `/restart`.
`TestEgressProfilesIntersectOnOneLookup`.

### M2 — Unauthenticated local vsock peers can invoke the guest agent as root (`fcguest/main.go`) — **fixed (defense in depth)**

Already mitigated, and the mitigation is load-bearing enough to deserve a
second layer. `fc-agent` binds `VMADDR_CID_ANY` and its `Exec`/`ExecStream`/
`ShellAttach`/`Init`/`Shutdown` ops run as PID 1, i.e. guest root — so anything
in-guest that could reach vsock would defeat the `root=no` profile outright.
Nothing can: `build-kernel.sh` refuses to produce a kernel with
`CONFIG_VSOCKETS_LOOPBACK=y` or `CONFIG_VHOST_VSOCK=y` (audit I1).

But that is a property of an ASSET — `fcassets/vmlinux` — which an operator can
replace, and the agent itself took the peer on faith. `vsockAcceptLoop` now
keeps the `SockaddrVM` that `accept` returns and refuses any peer whose CID is
not `VMADDR_CID_HOST`. The kernel guard stays the primary defense; this makes
it a backstop rather than the only one.

A per-VM shared secret was the other half of the suggested remediation and is
deliberately not taken: the secret would have to reach the guest over the same
vsock channel it is meant to protect, so it buys nothing against a peer that
can already speak on that channel.

### M4 — AttachShell permits cross-session tmux attachment within an authorized group (`daemon/grpc_server.go`) — **fixed (hygiene), claim partly rejected**

`open.Session` went to the guest unvalidated and became `tmux new-session -A -s
<value>`. Now pinned to `shellSessionRE` — `koto-shell` plus an optional
`-<chat session>`, which is exactly the namespace `shellSessionName` (TUI) and
`turn.go` (guest) mint. That closes the two real consequences: an arbitrary
selector created an unmanaged tmux session outside the group's namespace, and a
newline in it forged daemon log records.

The access-control framing does not hold. `attach_shell` on a group yields an
interactive shell as the guest worker uid, from which `tmux attach -t` reaches
every session in that VM — so restricting the selector cannot be the boundary
between conversations, and nothing here claims it is. Cross-conversation
isolation inside one group is a VM-level property koto does not offer; the
boundary is the group.

### M7 — Group-scoped Config permission bypasses field-level posture authorization (`daemon/grpc_server.go`) — **fixed**

Real, and the reasoning already existed on the other plane. `ConfigReq` carries
the delegable settings (`model`, `effort`, `provider`) and the posture keys
(`network`/`internet`, `root`, `ports`, `size`, `autostart`) in one message,
and the interceptor did one coarse `config` check against the group. So a role
granted "may set this group's model" could also give the group WAN egress,
passwordless guest sudo, a published host port, more of the host's RAM, or a
boot at daemon start.

`postureVerb` (auth.go) re-labels a posture-setting request as the synthetic
verb `config_posture`, which is in `adminOnlyVerbs` — so no acl.json grant
reaches it, `"*"` included. Reads and delegable-key writes stay `config`. This
is the gRPC twin of the ctl plane's posture refusal (audit H1, 2026-09-05);
the invariant is the same one, that `network=none` must not be voidable by
anything the default contains. `TestConfigPostureIsAdminOnly`.

### M5 — Security-sensitive helpers are resolved from an untrusted PATH (`daemon/install.go`) — **not a finding**
### M8 — `koto tui` executes an attacker-selected executable with administrator credentials (`daemon/tui_cmd.go`) — **not a finding**

Both reduce to "an attacker can write to a directory on the operator's PATH".
That attacker already executes as the operator on their next shell command —
`ls`, `git`, `make` — with no koto involved. koto's trust model names the host
user as tier 1 by definition; a defense here would protect nothing, because the
thing it protects runs as the principal it is defending against.

The one part of M8 with a distinct shape — resolving `koto-tui` from somewhere
the DAEMON can write, which is a tier-2→tier-1 crossing rather than a tier-1
one — was found and closed by the previous audit (L10, 2026-09-06): the
`<state>/koto-tui` fallback is gone, and the surviving dev-clone convenience
requires a cwd carrying a koto checkout's markers, which `ProtectSystem=strict`
keeps the daemon out of. The rationale is in the comment at `tuiMain`.

### M11 — Unvalidated cs-job IDs enable path traversal outside the jobs directory (`sidecar/cs-job`) — **fixed (hygiene)**

Correct as a bug, not as a boundary: `cs-job` runs as the guest worker in the
guest's own workspace, so `cs-job rm ../..` destroys exactly what `rm -rf
/workspace` already would. Fixed anyway, because no verb here has business
resolving outside `$JOBS`, and the realistic trigger is a model repeating a
malformed id back at itself rather than an adversary.

`chkid` rejects anything but a bare alphanumeric before the path is built, on
`_notify`, `wait`, `peek`, `status`, `logs` and `rm`. It is called as a
STATEMENT, never inside `$(...)`: a command substitution runs in a subshell, so
an `exit` there ends only the subshell and the caller proceeds with an empty id
— which for `rm -rf "$JOBS/$id"` is worse than the traversal. (Written the
wrong way first; the smoke test caught it.)

### M12 — Claude worker permanently bypasses all permission checks (`fcguest/turn.go`) — **accepted**

`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is not an oversight, it is the product. koto
runs unattended agents; an approval prompt with nobody to answer it is a hang,
and the flag is why every group is a microVM with no NIC by default rather than
a process on the host. The boundary is KVM plus the `network` and `root`
profiles, not the model's own tool gate — which is exactly why those two
profiles default closed and why posture is admin-only (M7).

The workspace-destruction consequence is the group's own workspace, which the
agent is supposed to own. The remediation's "run workers in least-privilege
disposable workspaces, keep network access disabled by default" is a
description of what koto already does.

### M13 — Root agent follows worker-controlled temporary-file symlinks (`fcguest/main.go`) — **fixed**

Real, and it crosses the one boundary inside the guest that `root=no` claims to
hold. `writeWorkerFile` wrote `path + ".tmp"` with `os.WriteFile` (which follows
symlinks) and then `os.Chown`ed it (which also follows), under directories that
are chowned to uid 1000 — so the worker could pre-create the predictable
temporary name as a symlink, have PID 1 truncate an arbitrary root-owned guest
file, and then take ownership of it.

Now `O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW` — which refuses an existing entry of any kind,
closing the race rather than sampling it — plus `fchown` on the descriptor
rather than on a name that can change underneath. The `os.Rename` needed no
change: it replaces `path`, it does not follow it.

### M14 — Destroyed groups retain executable schedules and can resurrect a reused group (`daemon/groups.go`) — **fixed**

Real, and not only as a security matter: `destroy()` cancelled goals and
disarmed the report window but left schedules alone, and a schedule fire is an
`enqueueSend` whose `sendNow` calls `ensure()` — so a destroyed group's cron
line rebuilt its VM and a blank workspace minutes after the operator deleted
it, and a later group reusing the name inherited the old group's schedules.

`delSchedsFor(g)` in `destroy()`, next to `disarmReport` and the event-ring
drop, which close the same name-reuse hazard for their own state. The generation
-id scheme the remediation proposes is not needed once the records are gone
with the group.

### M16 — Concurrent whole-file config updates can restore revoked group security posture (`daemon/config.go`) — **fixed**

Three callers — `configCmd`, `seedSpawnConfig`, `ensureProviderConfig` — each
parsed the whole `config.json`, changed a key or two, and wrote the whole
document back, with no lock between read and write. The last writer's stale
copy of every OTHER key wins, so an operator lowering `network` to none could
have it undone seconds later by a spawn seeding `provider` from a snapshot
taken before the change. Posture is admin-only (M7) exactly so it cannot be
lowered by a lesser principal; restoring it through a stale rewrite is the same
outcome by another route.

`updateGroupConfig` is now the only writer: a per-group mutex held across read,
mutate and commit, and a commit by rename so a reader sees one document or the
other. (`os.WriteFile` truncates in place, so readers could catch half a file.
`groupNetwork`/`groupRoot` fail CLOSED on a parse error, so that window was
never an escalation — but a config read silently answering "default" because it
caught a write mid-flight is not something to leave in.)
`TestGroupConfigUpdatesAreSerialized`.

### M17 — Send and schedule paths can provision arbitrary unregistered groups (`daemon/send.go`) — **fixed**

Real, and the root of M14's other half. `ensure()` created whatever
syntactically valid name it was handed, and it is reached from `send`, `clear`,
`restart`, a schedule fire and a shell attach — none of which carry spawn
authority. So a principal with `send` on `"*"` provisioned groups without
`spawn`, and the ctl plane's `ctlMaxSpawn` cap was reachable around rather than
through.

Split: `ensure()` boots a group that is registered in `groups.json` and errors
on an unknown name; `spawnEnsure()` is the creating path, called from exactly
three admission points — the ctl `spawn` verb, the `Spawn` RPC, and the
daemon's own boot of `main`. The cap moved with it: the `Spawn` RPC enforces
`ctlMaxSpawn` too, since `spawn` is an ordinary grantable verb and a non-admin
role holding it on `"*"` previously had no bound at all.
`TestEnsureDoesNotProvision`.

### M20 — Main-to-peer goals can bypass the mandatory human-approval gate (`daemon/goals.go`) — **fixed, partly rejected**

The ctl half is real. A main caller's `goal_set` always targets a peer (its own
group is refused), and plan-first on that path IS the human gate:
`goal_approve` is self-only precisely so main cannot approve a plan it set on a
peer. An explicit `"plan": false` went straight to `goalStatusRunning` and
started an autonomous, self-judged, multi-iteration loop on another group with
nobody in the loop. Now forced to plan-first, with a log line saying so. A
group setting a goal on ITSELF keeps `plan=false`: approving its own plan is
allowed, so it is the same authority by a shorter route.

The gRPC half is rejected. `GoalSet` over gRPC is the OPERATOR — the human the
gate exists to involve — so `plan=false` there is that human approving up
front, not a bypass. A gate that the person it defers to cannot also skip is
not a gate, it is an obstacle.
`TestMainPeerGoalsAreAlwaysPlanFirst`.
