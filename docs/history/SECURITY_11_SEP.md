# koto security assessment triage — 2026-09-11

Source: an automated assessment producing 339 findings (2 high, 166 medium,
171 low) against the daemon, guest agent, sidecar scripts and TUI.

This file is the ledger: every finding gets a verdict, and a verdict of
*accepted* or *not a finding* carries its reasoning, because an unexplained
"won't fix" is indistinguishable from an oversight on the next audit.

Verdicts:

- **fixed** — code changed, pinned by a test in `daemon/audit_fixes_test.go`.
- **accepted** — real, but the risk is the trust model's stated position.
- **not a finding** — the precondition does not exist, or the claim is wrong.

### H1 — Legacy `workspace.img` symlink enables cross-boundary VM disk redirection (`daemon/fc.go`) — **fixed**

`fcEnsureWorkspaceImg` accepted the image with `os.Stat`, which follows
symlinks, and every consumer downstream works on the PATH: `os.Truncate` +
`e2fsck` + `resize2fs` in the grow path, `os.Chown` in `fcJailFixupPerms`, and
the jail shim's bind mount, which hands the resolved inode to the guest as a
read-write block device — where the guest's mount fallback (`mkfs.ext4 -F` on
an unmountable `/dev/vdb`) would format it.

Planting the symlink needs write access to `groups/<g>/`, which under
Firecracker is tier 1 (there is no shared filesystem). The one exception is
the case the finding names: a **podman-era** workspace, which the migration
path deliberately treats as pre-existing untrusted input, and which a podman
sidecar had RW.

Fixed by `os.Lstat` + a regular-file check before anything touches the path.
Refusing the whole class beats reasoning about who wrote it.
`TestWorkspaceImgRefusesNonRegularFile`.

### H2 — Jailed Firecracker can impersonate its guest on the privileged host control plane (`daemon/fc.go`) — **accepted**

True as stated, unclosable, and not an escalation.

Firecracker's hybrid vsock makes every guest→host connection a `connect(2)`
**by the VMM process** to `<uds>_<port>` (see the channel map at the top of
`fc.go`). The VMM is definitionally the peer, so `SO_PEERCRED` cannot
distinguish "VMM relaying its guest" from "VMM acting alone", and a per-VM MAC
would have to be handed to the guest through that same VMM.

What the channel grants is exactly the authority the group's own guest already
holds — and a VMM compromise is reached *through* that guest, via a
virtio/vsock device-model bug, so the attacker held it already. The jailer's
actual claim is narrower and still holds: a VMM escape reaches no credentials,
no network, no other group's sockets, and no host filesystem outside its
chroot. Recorded in the comment at `fcJailFixupPerms`.
